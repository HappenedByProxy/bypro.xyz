	Search Engine Optimization is a thing used by Google and co. to determine what websites to display based on their 
attributes and reputation. Then again, reputation is out the window when you always get scam sites as adverts at the top of results 
due to keyword dumping and other tricks. The new design for my website is rather disliked by SEO crawlers because the framesets 
stop them from browsing the page correctly. They get confused and slap me with a low score because it couldn't find the index. Some 
sites give large penalties for having framesets. Hell, some give me a low score with a "high priority issue" because I don't have 
analytics or JS. Or, not having a 404 page (I'll have you know I prefer 418s). It goes on and on.<br><br> This is my website, I can 
do what 
I want with it. I don't care what the SEO crawlers have to say, whatever happened to having your own personal website? Everything 
just HAS to be for profit lately. Although I will admit, aside from the petty "you don't have Google APIs!" issues, it is right 
about rather simple things like elements should have titles, images should have alt attributes, specify the language of the page, 
etc. Those are acceptable issues, but penalising me for not having analytics is just sad.
