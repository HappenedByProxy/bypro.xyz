        ##############################################################
		
		In September, I begun making old-school styled 3D renders after listening to a lot of 90s and 00s drum &amp; bass. I'm not sure where I got the names of the software I use now, probably a YouTube comment on a mix somewhere. Either way, the software I use is Bryce 7, Genetica 4.0 and Wings 3D. <br><br>
		
		I begun documenting my adventures into Bryce 7 on the 5th of September 2021. At first I tried making dailys, but that quickly wore me out and I just do them whenever I feel like it now- it's no good squeezing out imagination like that. More on those adventures will come soon, but today I want to talk about my website.<br><br>
		
		So, what happened here!? It went from a rather modern site with that <strike>stupid</strike> Particle.JS floating around in the background, to a website that looks like it's been frozen in time since the 00s! Well, I've recently decided to reject that modern style and go back to the old ways of the Internet, when things were much simplier (and I was a toddler). <br>Personally, I'd call it anti-design, going against what is the norm right now. I'm sick of seeing Wordpress template websites for every business and blog in existance, needless amounts of JavaScript to get your damn advertisements to dynamically s t r e t c h themselves over the news article I'm trying to read. The web is a bloated mess, aimed at collecting as much user info as possible to maximise profits. I'm sick of it.<br><br>
		
		It's not the easiest to regress into this old style because I'm so used to modern design standards. I actually had to ditch Visual Studio because it kept autocorrecting my tags to lowercase, so now I'm using Notepad++. Amazingly, I managed to create the illusion of a dynamic website by accident, by using framesets. Nobody uses these anymore, they're deprecated in favour of iframes.<br><br>
		
		Look up at the URL, has it changed? No? That's because the buttons on the side are changing the source of the frame you're reading this text in. But the actual page, the "index" just contains 2 framesets- the sidebar, and this. You can even go back and forth and the URL won't change. Pure HTML. There is no JS on this website. There is CSS, but kept to a minimum.<br><br>
		
		And come on, it's not a geocities-type site without those "Under Construction!" gifs.
