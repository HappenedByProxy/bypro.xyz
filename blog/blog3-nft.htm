        BLOG 3 - NFTs
        ##############################################################
		
		I've had a few friends threaten to disown me for adventuring into NFTs. <br><br> I don't get what they're so mad about. I just want to take my art more seriously, and NFTs seem like a good thing to look into. Personally, I'm avoiding OpenSea as despite being public and easy to sign-up to, it's very, very oversaturated and people often mock it for those questionable-quality avatars. Instead, I browsed through several marketplaces and took interest in BlockParty. This is it, I'm making it my goal to become part of that marketplace- it's not public, you need to apply to get into it. This is why I'm here, revamping my portfolio and tidying up my online presence before I go into the deep end and begin my journey. <br><br>
		
		BlockParty is a rather small marketplace, but they're certainly not new to it. They've been around since 2017, but relaunched in 2020 as Blockparty 2.0. I've taken great interest into what they offer, something that I just couldn't find in other marketplaces. No gas fees, multichain minting, accepting both USD and ETH (although I'd rather stick with crypto, personally) and, the thing I'm most invested in; physicals. The ability to link a physical item to a virtual asset. I would LOVE to do that. I'd feel bad for just selling a digital asset, and I love the idea of printing out the art they bought, sending it to them with a little personal twist in it. In the past, when I've ordered some CDs from Bandcamp, I once got a postcard in with the items as a personal "thank you!" from the label. Some other time I got an email from an artist, also as a thanks for buying their music. It feels good to receive, so I'd love to give back.<br><br>
		
		I need a printer though, I'm struggling to find the right one. Canon seems to be the go-to brand for printing photos. I don't want something that costs more than my phone, but also don't want something that's cheaper than my weekly uni meals. HP is a no-go, their ink subscription is predatory, I've seen them lock people out of printers because they ended the subscription or didn't pay for it.
