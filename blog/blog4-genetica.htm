        BLOG 4 - Who is Spiral Graphics Inc., anyway?
        ##############################################################

        Recently, I decided to look for more information about some software I use, Genetica. Genetica is a procedual, node based seamless texture generator, developed by Spiral Graphics. Don't let the footer fool you, it's just an automatically updated one. The last update to their website was sometime in 2015, where there's been a neverending "holiday discount" since then. If you go to their index, there is a link to their now-dead forums too. By the look of it on archive.org, this was once a pretty popular place. But what happened? I'm trying to find out, primarily from curiousity.<br><br>

        Within the program are some textures that require materials from external servers. Obviously, you can't get these anymore because they're down too. Using Process Monitor, I discovered that it's trying to connect to "apache2-fritz.washington.dreamhost.com". Is it up? Yes! Is it functional? Well, no.<br><br>

        Riiight, so what about the "About" tab in the program? Surely that has credits?<br><br>

        Some textures have credits on them-<br><Br>

        It took me a solid minute to realise that "tex" stands for "textures", not as a name. I'd send an email, but ideally it'd be to a webmaster, not the texture guy. Okay, we need to get more technical here.

        <h2>The state of Spiral Graphics Inc.</h2><p>
        Some searches of this name come up with some pretty consistent results. First of all, we have this profile which matches the company we're looking for!<br><br>
        <img src="images/blog4-bizapedia.png" width="100%"><br><br>

        There was never any official news about Spiral Graphics Inc. closing down. However, their current filing status is <b>"delinquent"</b>, meaning they've missed multiple payments. Their last payment was in 2017, given "delinquent" status in 2018 and ever since then there's been silence.<br><br>

        There was one result that I ignored, though. When searching for "Alkis Roufas", there was one result for his "public court records". Of course, you need to pay to see them though. In Colorado, if a business owner dies, the business' estate becomes the new owner of the business. Or, if it's a small business, the business gets terminated. But what if the owner goes to jail? I can't find any proper information on this. A mysterious ending to this whole research, it's unclear where Alkis Roufas is right now. Either way, spiralgraphics.biz will stay online until 2027, where it will disappear with the rest of the old web.<br><br> Better get archiving.
