        ##############################################################

        Happy new years. 

        For me, individuality is rather important. But, it also gets in the way of things sometimes. The effort to remain "unique" can cause me to miss out on a lot. For example, I despise WordPress for various reasons. Not just from a security standpoint, but a creative point too. WordPress is so horribly bland- find me a business website that wasn't made with a template, and I might just tip you Â£10. Whatever happened to homemade webstes? They have a distinctive style, they stand out amongst the rest, and sure it takes a lot of effort if you're brand new, but that "shitty" style is what I miss. Occasionally I like to open up Google Maps and click on all nearby businesses, checking their website for templates or over expensive SSL certificates (why use anything but Lets Encrypt?).

        If you're trying to build a portfolio, and you use a template for your website, I think you're being misled here. Even if HTML isn't what you're specialising in, the ability to build your own website from scratch and host it is some of the best work you can show, in my opinion. When a potential employer visits, you can proudly say "I built all of this by myself". A template really doesn't impress me, and I'm not sure if it'll impress employers. I don't know, I'm not an employer.
