        BLOG [] - My ideal server setup
        ##############################################################

        I'm not much of a stranger to setting up Ubuntu servers anymore.

        Firstly, reduce all the entry points of a server to only one- SSH. You don't need anything else. Then, make it so you need a key, user and password to connect. You can then drop any connection attempt that doesn't send over the required key. If you're super into security (and don't use a dynamic IP address) you can make it so only your IP can connect, but personally I don't reccomend this as you may just lose access to your server entirely.

        Secondly, take off everything you don't need. Seriously, when you're running on a small disk, space is everything. When you can, opt for a minimal installation of any OS- you really don't need 90% of the junk it installs. Install what you need yourself.
