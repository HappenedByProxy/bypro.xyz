	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>
	Abstract, Surreal, Liminal.<br><br>
	
	I'm a 19 year old student from Wales, studying applied cybersecurity full-time.<br>
	I do art as a hobby on the side, and have been doing it since 2019. I use art as an outlet for venting and my imagination.<br>
	I make old-school styled 3D renders using an assortment of rather old software, as well as glitch art.<br>
	Influenced by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK8ilaPZbKE" target="_blank">images on 90s/00s drum & bass mixes,</a> I begun my 3D journey on the 5th of September while documenting it <a href="https://twitter.com/HappenedByProxy/status/1434315723023785985" target="_blank">on Twitter.</a><br><br>

	I'm an advocate for a free and open source internet, an archivist of a lot of data and an avid connoisseur of music.<br>
	</p>

	<h2>How my 3D art began</h2>
	<p>

		It began when I had a bad case of the flu, I was up all night so I went downstairs to try and relax. First, I played some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xw5AiRVqfqk" target="_blank">selected ambient works</a>, then, thanks to autoplay, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK8ilaPZbKE" target="_blank">drum & bass set from 1996 played afterwards.</a><br> 
		I fell in love with not only the music, but  the images being displayed as the video progressed. The futuristic, utopian aesthetic was irresistable.<br>
		Thanks to the Ambiance YouTube channel for saving these otherwise forgotten about sets and mixes.
